								<h4><u>Changing ideas about the burial ritual:</u></h4>
								<p>Multiple deposition “allowed for a different kind of interaction with the (buried) dead” (Willemsen 124). With single burials, a body was covered and—hopefully—never again disturbed. In contrast, these chamber tombs required people to come face-to-face with death. They confronted the fact that physical bodies decomposed; even if the niches were walled off, there was still a moment of entering a space of the dead in which they had to think about (and probably smell) what was going on right next to them.</p>
								<p>Willemsen believes that at this time there was less effort being invested in burial rituals, particularly in regards to how much labor was spent on creating a tomb. While this may seem contradictory looking at such a monumental project as a chamber tomb, Archaic tombs all held more than one body, so it actually decreased the amount of space per person, as shown by a study done at Crustumerium (123).</p>
								<p>As you can see by navigating in the chamber, it’s a tight squeeze. Only a select few got to be involved in the actual burial process, which was a contrast to the larger ceremonies in previous centuries. Not everyone could fit inside the chamber tomb, so there was a layering of priority between the funeral outside and the depositional process inside. (Willemsen 136).</p>
								<h4><u>Belief in an afterlife:</u></h4>
								<p>Before, chamber tombs were large, elaborate constructions so that the deceased had plenty of room and comfort to “live on” in the tomb space. During the Archaic period, tomb sizes shrank. W. says that this “may indicate that a large open space was no longer required, since it was believed that the tomb was only a first stop on the journey to the hereafter” (Williemsen 132). Now we see a separation of body and soul and a new concept of the “spirit.” This helps explain why multidepositions became common. The body was just a body, and there was no need to tiptoe around a tomb that no longer held any spiritual entity. We can also see that there is less concern with maintaining separation between those who were still alive and those who were dead. In many tombs prior to this period, niches were firmly walled off with strong material like tuff slabs. The closing systems began to be less important (and disappeared altogether eventually), and this can be seen in our tomb as well, where the bodies were probably walled off with wood (Willemsen 15, 31). The iron nails are remnants of this type of system.</p>
								<h4><u>Chamber tombs and urbanization:</u></h4>
								<p>Because this class has examined urbanism in relation to Gabii, it is interesting to note that the decreasing time spent on burial practice and a new form of expressing elite status relates possibly reflects a new way of life due to urbanization. Willemsen suggests that as lower classes steadily began to copy the elites in burial practices that involved grave goods and elaborate chamber tombs, the elites sought a new way to define themselves. Ironically, simpler tombs, like ours, would have been the new way to distinguish elite burials. More importantly, the elite sought new avenues to invest their wealth in, and building projects and public structures provided the perfect opportunity, which the lower classes could not get involved in (130). The paper also suggests that during this time, the center for religious practice transferred from burial grounds to urban structures like sanctuaries (135).</p>
